# liri-bot

# Project overview
LIRI is a command line Node app that takes in parameters and returns data from the following APIs: Bandsintown, Spotify and OMDb.

# How it works
Type into the command line....

node liri.js spotify-this-song "song name here" to return song information from Spotify. If no song is entered, a hard coded default song will return.

node liri.js movie-this "movie name here" to return movie information from OMDb. If no movie is entered, a hard coded default movie will return. (This is not currently working)
